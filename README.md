# Sublime Text 2 Color Schemes
Light white to grey color scheme for the Sublime Text 2 code editor (ST2). To install...

2. Open your Sublime Text 2 package folder by launching Sublime and selecting "Preferences > Browse Packages..." from the main application menu.
3. Copy the .tmtheme file to the "User" folder in the "Packages" directory.
4. From Sublime, select "Preferences > Color Scheme > User > [scheme name]" from the main application menu to activate the color scheme.

This scheme is based on Espresso Soda color scheme. It was tweaked to work best in Python.
